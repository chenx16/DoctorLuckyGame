# DoctorLuckyGame
This semester, we are going to develop a kind of board game that is very loosely inspired by the Doctor Lucky series of gamesLinks to an external site. created by Cheapass GamesLinks to an external site.. The game will be developed in 4 parts and delivered as milestones. The goal of this milestone is to start building the model that will be used in our MVC project.

To create a text file that captures the output and save it in plain text format (i.e., .txt), use the following command
